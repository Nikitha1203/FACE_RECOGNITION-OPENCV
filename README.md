# FACE_RECOGNITION-OPENCV
This project is a simple real-time face detection application using OpenCV. 
It captures video from your computer's webcam, processes each frame, and detects faces in real-time.

Detected faces are highlighted with rectangles in the video feed. 
It can serve as a foundation for more advanced computer vision applications, such as facial recognition or emotion detection.


Tools Used
Python: The programming language used for the project.
OpenCV (cv2): A popular computer vision library used for real-time image and video processing.
Haar Cascade Classifier: A pre-trained machine learning model provided by OpenCV for face detection.
